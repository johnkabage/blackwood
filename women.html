          Your spouse may have told you to change your shirt before work, but
          does that kind of thing really matter in a business setting? Isn’t
          your knowledge more influential than your appearance? In fact, your
          appearance has a much greater influence on your customers than you
          might realize. The first impression is everything, particularly where
          customers are concerned. Your appearance has a strong effect on your
          their subconscious, and the wrong appearance can easily make them feel
          a little uneasy, hurting your business in the long run.

          If you don’t believe it, consider a study featured on Psychology today
          that analyzed the snap judgments of 300 men and women who were exposed
          to different images of the same man and woman for three seconds at a
          time. In one photo the man wore a tailor-made suit and in the others
          he wore a similar suit with no tailoring. The woman appeared in one
          photo in a fitted skirt suit, and in the others, she appeared in
          various forms of less-fitting skirt and pants suits.

          Considering the way you dress is perhaps most important when it comes
          to dressing for your customers. Anytime you have a client meeting or
          are presenting yourself in front of customers, your attire should be
          professional. However, choosing a tailored suit isn’t the only thing
          to consider when purchasing new clothing for the office. There are
          several things that go into dressing for success in front of your
          customers and clients.
