          Why this arguably works better is the details of getting dressed tell
          us multiple details about Gem. The last minute change suggests an
          indecisive nature. We see the contrast between the character’s
          friend’s reaction and the advisory words of Gem’s aunt. The fact Gem
          goes with jeans and a tee could suggest that she trusts her aunt’s
          advice, or else feels shamed by her Aunt and compelled to be ‘good’.
          There is simply more characterization, not only of Gem but the other
          example characters.

          For many, the cost of high-quality shoes may seem uncomfortably high.
          Premium shoes are worth the price, though—they boast a high level of
          wearing comfort and are significantly longer-lasting than their
          cheaply mass-produced counterparts. When considered in the long term,
          purchasing quality shoes is actually easier on the wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
          On average, we cover about 3 kilometres per day by foot. This adds up
          over the course of our lives—in total, we actually cover a distance
          equivalent to circumnavigating the globe two and a half times. As we
          go about our daily walking, our shoes are the only protection we have
          from hard asphalt, sharp stones and other people's (accidental)
          treads.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, high-quality Goodyear-welted shoes offer a multitude
          of benefits, and can notably improve the quality of life and
          capability of their wearer. They increase wearing comfort, reinforce
          foot health and, through their perfect fit and construction, ensure an
          elegant appearance, one which can be perfected with knowledge of the
          correct dress code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our comprehensive shoe encyclopaedia teaches readers how to identify
          the quality of premium men's shoes, as well as how premium shoes
          differ from cheaply mass-produced models. Our reader will find out how
          to select models with the perfect fit as well as how, through proper
          care, he can ensure a long lifespan for his shoes.
