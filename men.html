          Why this arguably works better is the details of getting dressed tell
          us multiple details about Gem. The last minute change suggests an
          indecisive nature. We see the contrast between the character’s
          friend’s reaction and the advisory words of Gem’s aunt. The fact Gem
          goes with jeans and a tee could suggest that she trusts her aunt’s
          advice, or else feels shamed by her Aunt and compelled to be ‘good’.
          There is simply more characterization, not only of Gem but the other
          example characters.
